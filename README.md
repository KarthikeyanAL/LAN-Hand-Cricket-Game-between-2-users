# LAN-Hand-Cricket-Game-between-2-users
This game application is totally fun. Users who are on their console are
randomly connected or connected to their friend. Only by knowing theirfriendâ€™s
id they can happily play with their friend. Actually, two playersare paired up one
is batsman and another one is bowler. When both are ready to play game starts.
Then both players have to select their choice (1/2/3/4/5/6). According to the
players choice the outcomes are obtained.
The rules for this game are as follows:
Toss: Here we just need 2 players for this game. One should choose Odd or
Even? and the other should say with either of choices. Odd means an odd
number and even means an even number. your friend chose odd and then you
get even, and conversely. Finally, who win thetoss choose either bat or bowl.
The important part. So here is how we should represent each number
For 1, just throw your hand with ONLY your index finger extended, and the
others fingers are closed.
For 2, just open two adjacent fingers.
For 3, just open middle, ring, small fingers. For
4, just append index finger to the three. For 5,
open all fingers.
For 6, just your thumb extended and remaining closed.

Suppose opponent won the toss and chose to bowl. You are now batting.It is just
like the "toss" section and but this time batsman get runs. So, batsman and
bowler just throw their hands at the same time like playing rock paper scissors,
and need should throw a number and other should also throw a number. Let's
think bowler threw a 6 and batsman threw a 4, then batsman get 4 runs.
Now batsman cannot just simply keep scoring runs, then the game will be
infinite (unless your friends get you out). Batsman just keep running.Here comes
another important part: Wickets.
Let's think that batsman scored about 23 runs and he want to score a 6. So
batsman throw a 6 but at the same time, your friend (Bowler) also threw a 6. And
then, batsman is out. Now the bowler gets to bat and batsman(you) get to bowl,
and the target is your score+1, in this case, 24(23+1) and if batsman scored about
20 and he thinks of placing a 2 and bowler(you) also place a 2, then
batsman(opponent) is out and you(Bowler) win the match! Now you can just start
again from the toss over by asking "Odd or even".
For the success full development of this game there are few concepts Computer
Networks which acted as building blocks for this project. The whole project is
working on Server-Client topology. Protocols like TCP (Transfer Control
Protocol), IPv4 (Internet Protocol -version 4) areused. For designing the
graphical user interface pygame module and with help of Socket Programming
the Network things are happened.
